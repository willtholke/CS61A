### What is Computer Science?

**Computer science** is the overarching term that describes the mechanism through which we approach problem-solving using computers. Effective solutions might consist of techniques involving *systems, artificial intelligence, graphics, security, networking, programming languages, or theory*.

### What is CS 61A?

- Managing complexity with **abstraction**
- Introduction to programming: full understanding of Python fundamentals, combining ideas in large projects, how computers interpret programming languages

### Alternatives to CS 61A

**CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing** – an introduction to fundamentals (& Python) that sets students up for success in CS 61A

**Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science** – fundamentals of computing, statistical inference, & machine learning applied to real-world data sets
